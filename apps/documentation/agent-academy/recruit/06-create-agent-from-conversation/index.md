# 🚨 Mission 06: Create a custom agent using natural language with AI and grounding it with your data {#mission-06-create-a-custom-agent-using-natural-language-with-ai-and-grounding-it-with-your-data}

<mission-meta />

## 🎯 Mission Brief {#mission-brief}

Create a custom agent from scratch using natural language and enhance it with your own data.

This lesson focuses on building a practical agent that can respond to users using relevant enterprise information. You will design, configure, and test a customised help desk agent that answers IT questions using approved knowledge sources such as SharePoint, uploaded files, or company URLs.

## 🔎 Objectives {#objectives}

In this mission, you’ll learn:

1. Understanding what custom agents are and how they differ from pre-built templates
1. Creating agents using natural language prompts with AI
1. Grounding agents with enterprise knowledge sources including SharePoint, documents, and websites
1. Learning about generative orchestration and how agents dynamically search and respond using multiple data sources
1. Building and testing a fully functional IT helpdesk agent that can answer questions from your own data

## 🤔 What is a _custom_ agent? {#what-is-a-custom-agent}

A custom agent is a chatbot or virtual assistant that you create and design in Copilot Studio to help users with specific tasks or questions. It's called custom because:

- **You decide the purpose** - help users request vacation time, check order status, provide assistance with IT related questions.
- **You define the conversation** - what the agent says and how it should respond.
- **You ground it with your data**  - connect to your knowledge resources such as documents, SharePoint sites and public websites.


> [!NOTE]
> Think of it this way: you are building your own digital helper that can talk to users and complete tasks for them such as answering questions, collecting information required by a process, or connecting to your enterprise data.

### 🤖 What can a custom agent do? {#what-can-a-custom-agent-do}

A custom agent can fulfill the following:

- Ask users for information such as names, dates, or preferences.
- Save that information to a database or table.
- Look up data based on the questions asked and answer them.
- Work autonomously without users directly interacting with the agent.
- Trigger actions either on-demand through direct user interaction or autonomously such as sending emails.

### 👩🏻‍💻  Why use a custom agent? {#why-use-a-custom-agent}

- Saves time by automating repetitive tasks.
- Gives users a friendly, guided experience.
- Tailor it to your business or project needs.

### ✨ Example {#example}

You build a custom agent that helps employees request vacation leave.

It asks for their name, vacation dates, and their manager’s name, then saves the information into the designated SharePoint list for managing vacation requests.

Now, instead of navigating to the SharePoint list and creating a new item, employees simply chat with the agent instead.

## 🗣️ Use natural language to create agents {#use-natural-language-to-create-agents}

Previously you learnt how to quickly build agents in Copilot Studio using prebuilt agent templates in [Lesson 05 - Get started quickly with pre-built agents](../05-using-prebuilt-agents/index.md). In this lesson, we'll dive into the conversational authoring experience with AI. In Copilot Studio, you don’t need to write code to create an agent. Copilot Studio makes it easy to build agents by starting with a description in your own words (natural language).

When you start by describing your agent in natural language, the AI automatically generates the agent’s name, description, and instructions. It also proposes triggers, channels, knowledge sources, and tools. You can accept or ignore these suggestions, but they only last for the current session and won’t be saved.

## 🌱 But I'm new to "describing what I want" - what do I do? {#but-im-new-to-describing-what-i-want-what-do-i-do}

Describing in natural language to create a custom agent might be a new concept for you. Whenever you use Copilot across Microsoft products and services, you are using natural language in the form of a _prompt_.

A prompt is the message or instruction you give to an AI agent to tell it what you want it to do. Think of it as giving directions to an assistant. The clearer your instructions are, the easier it is for AI to understand and act on them.

### 🪄 Why Prompts matter {#why-prompts-matter}

- They guide the agent’s behavior.
- They help the agent understand what kind of conversation to have.
- A good prompt makes the agent more helpful and accurate.

### 📝 Tips for writing a good prompt {#tips-for-writing-a-good-prompt}

- Be clear and specific - say exactly what you want the agent to do.
- Think like the user - what will the user say? What should the agent reply?
- Include examples - if possible, give a sample interaction.

> [!TIP]
> ✨ Example
>
> Let's say the HR team needs an agent to help with vacation requests.
>
> The prompt could be,
>
> `I want to build an agent that helps users submit a vacation request. When a user says they want to request time off, the agent should ask for their name, the start date of their vacation, the end date of their vacation, and their manager’s name. Once the user provides this information, the agent should save it to a SharePoint list called 'Vacation Requests' and post a notification in a dedicated Microsoft Teams channel.`
>
> Why this prompt works:
>
> - **Clearly states the goal** - submit a vacation request
> - **Describes the user interaction** - what the user says and what the agent should ask
> - **Lists the required data** - name, start date, end date, manager
> - **Mentions where the data goes** - a SharePoint list called Vacation Requests

## 🔮 OK, I've created my agent... how do I next ground it with knowledge? {#ok-ive-created-my-agent-how-do-i-next-ground-it-with-knowledge}

In Copilot Studio, knowledge sources are places where your agent can find information to give better answers. When you add these sources, your agent can pull in data from public websites, documents or your Microsoft 365 data including SharePoint and OneDrive. 

These sources work together with AI to help your agent respond more accurately to user questions, this is achieved through what is known as **generative orchestration**.

### 🌿 What is generative orchestration in the context of agents? {#what-is-generative-orchestration-in-the-context-of-agents}

Generative orchestration means the agent uses AI to dynamically decide how to answer a question by combining its built-in language skills with information from your added knowledge sources.

When a user asks a question, the agent:

- Understands the question using AI.
- Can ask users for missing information by generating questions on the fly.
- Selects the most relevant knowledge sources.
- Searches those sources for answers.
- Generates a natural, helpful response using the information it found.

### 🏦 Why knowledge sources matter? {#why-knowledge-sources-matter}

1. **Smarter answers** - when you add knowledge sources, your agent can give better, more accurate answers using real organizational data.

1. **Less manual work** - you don’t have to write every possible response. The agent can search through your added sources and respond automatically.

1. **Use trusted information** - your agent can pull answers from systems you already use such as SharePoint or company websites so that users have reliable information from a source of truth.

1. **Works with generative AI** - knowledge sources and AI help your agent understand questions and respond naturally, even if the question wasn't pre-programmed or added as a starter prompt.

1. **Flexible and expandable** - you can add knowledge sources anytime during set up or at later point in time, your agent grows smarter as your needs change.

> [!TIP]
> ✨ Example
>
> Imagine you build an agent to help employees with HR questions. You add your company’s HR policy document and SharePoint site as knowledge sources.
>
> When an employee asks, _“How many vacation days am I entitled to?”_, the agent uses generative orchestration to search those sources and reply with the correct policy without you having to write that answer manually. This saves you time in having to account for every possible question an employee may ask regarding their entitlements.

## Types of knowledge sources that can be added

1. **Public websites**
    - **What it does:** Searches specific websites using Bing.
    - **Why it’s useful:** Great for pulling in public-facing info like FAQs or product details.

1. **Documents**
    - **What it does:** Uses documents that you upload directly to your agent, such as PDFs or Word files. 
    - **Why it's useful:** Enables your agent to answer questions based on internal guides, manuals or policies.

1. **SharePoint**
    - **What it does:** Connects to SharePoint folders or files powered by [Work IQ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/11/18/microsoft-ignite-2025-copilot-and-agents-built-to-power-the-frontier-firm/#microsoft-365-copilot-with-work-iq-ai-built-for-work).
    - **Why it's useful:** Ideal for accessing team documents, HR policies, or project files stored in SharePoint.


## 🔒 Note on security {#note-on-security}

### Knowledge source authentication

Some sources such as SharePoint require user authentication. This means the agent will only reference data in its response that the user is allowed to see. 

## Improving your agent's responses in Copilot Studio

After your agent is provisioned from the conversational authoring experience, you'll want to test your agent against the instructions AI generated from your prompt. Improving your agent’s responses in Copilot Studio is all about making sure it understands your goals clearly and has the right information to work with.

1. **Refine the agent instructions** - this is where you tell your agent how it should behave. Use clear, specific language.

    For example:

    ✅ “Act like a friendly customer support agent who explains things simply.”

    ❌ “Be helpful.” (Too vague)

1. **Check the tone and language** - make sure the agent’s tone matches your audience.

    You can set it to be:

    - Friendly and casual.
    - Professional and concise.
    - Supportive and patient.

1. **Add or update knowledge sources** - if your agent needs to answer questions about a topic, make sure it has access to the right information.

    - Add links to websites, documents, or FAQs.
    - Keep the content up to date.
    - Use clear, well-structured information.

1. **Use Topics and Triggers** - If your agent needs to handle specific tasks or conversations, you can create topics with trigger phrases. This helps guide the conversation more precisely. We'll learn more about this in the following lesson.

1. **Test with real questions** - try asking your agent the kinds of questions users might ask.

    If the answers aren’t great:

    - Adjust the system instructions.
    - Add more examples or knowledge.
    - Rephrase your questions to see how it responds.

1. **Review and iterate** - improving an agent is an ongoing process!

    After publishing:

    - Collect feedback.
    - Watch for common questions or confusion.
    - Keep refining the agent’s setup.

## 🧪 Lab 06: Create a custom agent in Copilot Studio {#lab-06-create-a-custom-agent-in-copilot-studio}

We're now going to learn how to create a custom agent that can chat over your data

### ✨ Use case {#use-case}

We'll use the same use case from [Lesson 03 - Create a declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot](../03-create-a-declarative-agent-for-M365Copilot/index.md#use-case-scenario)

**As an** employee

**I want to** get quick and accurate help from the IT helpdesk agent for issues like device problems, network troubleshooting, printer setup

**So that I can** stay productive and resolve technical issues without delays

Let's begin!

### ✨ Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

- **SharePoint site**

We'll be using the **Agent Academy Training** SharePoint site https://woodsideenergy.sharepoint.com/sites/AgentAcademyTrainingSite


### 6.1 Use natural language to create an agent with AI

> [!WARNING]
> AI generated instructions may differ across sessions
>
> When you start by describing your agent in natural language, the AI generated name, description, instructions can vary in each session. This also applies to the proposed triggers, channels, knowledge sources and tools.

1. Navigate to the Home page of Copilot Studio and in the field, enter the following prompt which describes the IT help desk agent.

    ```text
    You are an IT Help Desk assistant that helps employees resolve common IT issues and find available devices. Be polite, concise, and helpful. Use Microsoft Support as the primary source: https://support.microsoft.com (and Microsoft Learn troubleshooting if needed: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/). Do not invent steps - if you can't verify official guidance, say so and offer safe diagnostics + escalation.

    For troubleshooting:
    1) Ask ONE focused question if details are missing (goal, symptom/error, app/device).
    2) Try quick fixes first (restart, connectivity, sign-in, service status).
    3) Provide numbered step-by-step instructions (short, actionable).
    4) If not resolved, offer 1-2 alternative branches.
    5) After 2-3 branches, recommend escalation and provide a "ticket summary" of symptoms + error + device/app + what was tried.

    For devices:
    1) Ask what type of device do they need

    Never ask for passwords/OTP. Refuse requests to bypass security.
    Include relevant Microsoft Support links and preserve URLs.
    ```

    The prompt covers:

    - **Role and goal:** IT Help Desk assistant
    - **Primary knowledge sources** including a hierarchy for the website knowledge sources
    - **Response style:** polite, concise, helpful
    - **Troubleshooting flow:** Question > quick fixes > steps > branches > escalation
    - **Escalation artifact:** ticket summary
    - **Device support (basic)**
    - **Security boundaries**: no passwords, no bypassing security
    - **Link handling:** preserve URLs, cite Microsoft Support

    ![Enter prompt](./assets/6.1_01_Prompt.png)


1. Once the agent has been provisioned, you'll see a confirmation appear. Notice how AI automatically generated the **name**, **description** and **instructions** for your agent. The orchestration mode is enabled by default (found in **Settings**) and the default model is used for the response model of the agent.

    > [!WARNING]
    > 
    > Reminder: AI generated instructions may differ across sessions
    > When you start by describing your agent in natural language, the AI generated name, description, instructions can vary in each session. This also applies to the proposed triggers, channels, knowledge sources and tools.

    ![Setting up agent](./assets/6.1_03_AgentProvisioned.png)

1. Scroll down to review the AI suggestions for knowledge sources, tools and triggers.

    ![Knowledge sources and tools sections with suggestions from AI](./assets/6.1_04_KnowledgeAndTools.png)

1. Scroll down some more to review the Connected Agents, Topics and Suggested Prompts sections.

    ![Connected Agents, Topics and Suggested Prompts sections](./assets/6.1_05_ConnectedAgentsTopicsSuggestedPrompts.png)

1. Now let's update the name of our agent. Select **Edit** in the **Details** section.

    ![Select Edit in Details section](./assets/6.1_08_EditDetails.png)

1. Enter the following as the name of the agent and **Save** the updated details.

    ```text
    Contoso Helpdesk Agent
    ```

    ![Update agent name](./assets/6.1_09_AgentName.png)

1. We'll now add the suggested knowledge sources. In the **Knowledge** section, select **+ Add** for the website URL of `https://support.microsoft.com`

    ![Select add for the suggested website URL](./assets/6.1_10_AddSuggestedWebsite.png)

1. The **Add public websites** modal appears with the website URL. Select **Add**.

    ![Select add](./assets/6.1_11_AddWebsite.png)

1. Add another website using the below URL and select **Add to agent**.

    ```text
    https://learn.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/
    ```

    ![Add second website URL](./assets/6.1_12_AddAdditionalWebsite.png)

1. The two website URLs have now been added as knowledge sources for our agent. Select **X Dismiss** to remove the second suggestion by AI.

    ![Select Dismiss](./assets/6.1_13_SelectDismiss.png)

1. By default the **Web Search** setting is enabled. Select the **toggle** to disable the **Web Search** feature as we only want the agent to use the knowledge sources we define.

    ![Disable Web Search](./assets/6.1_14_DisableWebSearch.png)

1. Let's now test our newly created agent. In the **Testing** pane on the right hand side, select the **new test session** icon.

    ![Select start new test session in testing pane](./assets/6.1_15_StartNewTestSession.png)

1. Enter the following question in the **Testing** pane.

    ```text
    How can I check the warranty status of my Surface?
    ```

    ![Test newly created agent](./assets/6.1_16_EnterQuestion.png)

1. The Activity map will then load which shows us in real-time what path the agent is processing. In this scenario, our agent has understood the question and searches the knowledge sources using the two website URLs.

    Our agent responds with answers that are outlined as numbered step-by-step instructions, as defined in the instructions. The response has references to the [https://support.microsoft.com](https://support.microsoft.com) website that the agent formed its response from. This enables users to verify the source of the answer.

    ![References in response](./assets/6.1_17_References.png)

Congratulations! You've built your first custom agent by starting with a description in Copilot Studio 🙌🏻

### 6.2 Add an internal knowledge source using a SharePoint site

Previously, we added a public website as an external knowledge source for our agent during the conversational creation experience. We're now going to add an internal knowledge source using a SharePoint site. This will be the SharePoint site, Agent Academy Training Site, that has been created for these exercises. This site contains demo data for the fictional company "Contoso IT". This data is not used for anything real at Woodside.

1. In the **Knowledge** section, select **+ Add knowledge** and select **SharePoint**.

    ![Select SharePoint](./assets/6.2_01_SelectSharePoint.png)

1. Paste in the **address of the SharePoint site** [Agent Academy Training Site](https://woodsideenergy.sharepoint.com/sites/AgentAcademyTrainingSite) in the SharePoint URL field and select **Add**.

    Update the **name** of the SharePoint site to `Contoso IT` and select **Add to agent**.

    ![Update SharePoint site name and select Add to agent](./assets/6.2_02_AddSharePointSite.png)

1. The SharePoint site has now been added as a knowledge source with a status of _Ready_. The Status column will show whether the knowledge source has been loaded/connected to successfully, or if there is an issue.

    ![SharePoint site status](./assets/6.2_03_SharePointSiteAdded.png)

### 6.3 Add an internal knowledge source by uploading a document

We'll now add another internal knowledge source by uploading a document directly to our agent.

1. In the **Knowledge** section, select **+ Add knowledge** and select **Upload file** or **select to browse**.

    ![Select upload files](./assets/6.3_01_SelectUploadFile.png)

1. Download this <a href="./assets/Contoso_Guest_WiFi_Connection_Guide.docx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sample file</a> and select it in your File Explorer. Select **Open**.

    ![Select document](./assets/6.3_02_SelectWordFile.png)

1. The file has been selected for upload. Select **Add to agent** next.

    ![Select Add to Agent](./assets/6.3_03_SelectAddToAgent.png)

1. The document will be in the process of being added to the agent. Wait until the upload has completed, do not close the browser window.

    ![Document added](./assets/6.3_04_FileAdded.png)

1. The status of the document will initially show as _In progress_, wait until the status has been updated to **Ready** before testing your agent.

    ![File status](./assets/6.3_05_FileStatus.png)

Let's now test our agent!

### 6.4 Test agent

We'll test our four knowledge sources by asking questions to our Contoso Helpdesk Agent.

1. Select the **new test session** icon in the test pane.

    Enter the following question to test our public website (external) knowledge source.

      ```text
      How can I find the serial number on my Surface device?
      ```

      ![Select start a new test session icon](./assets/6.4_01_EnterQuestion1.png)

1. You'll next see the agent reviewing the knowledge sources and providing a response using the website knowledge source.

    A response will be returned and notice how there are references to the web page it formed its answer from.

    ![Question 1 response](./assets/6.4_02_Question1Response.png)

1. If you scroll down the knowledge modal in the activity map, you'll see the other knowledge sources the agent searched, which is the other website URL, SharePoint site and the uploaded file.

    However these were not used as in the **Referenced sources** section, the first website knowledge source was only referenced. The answer was grounded using the first website knowledge source. If you select the references, you'll be directed to the web page.

    ![Knowledge sources referenced and searched](./assets/6.4_03_OtherSourcesSearchedOver.png)

1. Let's now test both our SharePoint site knowledge source and document knowledge source in a single message. Enter the following question.

    ```text
    How can I access our company's Contoso VPN from my device? How do guests connect to the Contoso Guest wifi?
    ```

    ![Test SharePoint and document knowledge sources](./assets/6.4_04_EnterQuestion2Question3.png)

1. Once again you'll see the agent reviewing all four knowledge sources to generate a response to the two questions submitted in a single message. The agent responds to both questions in a single message, and provides separate references of where it generated its response from.

    In the knowledge modal in the activity map, you'll see the SharePoint site referenced for the Question 1 in regard to accessing the Contoso VPN. You have full visibility of what knowledge sources were used to answer both questions in the activity modal.

    ![Knowledge sources referenced for Question 1 and Question 2](./assets/6.4_05_Question2Response.png)

1. Scroll down to the response for Question 2 in regard to the Contoso Guest wifi. Again, we'll see a response that's grounded using the uploaded file that contains the details.

    ![Question 3 response](./assets/6.4_06_Question3Response.png)

1. In the activity modal, notice how the second website URL was also referred to but not used as one of the referenced sources.

    ![Activity modal of other sources searched over](./assets/6.4_07_OtherSourcesSearchedOver.png)

1. It's always good to verify the generated response is correct. Select the document reference and a modal will appear with the text from the document that reflects the answer.

    ![Review document](./assets/6.4_08_VerifyDocument.png)

The agent can answer multiple questions in a single message, and search the knowledge sources + reference the knowledge sources in its response. Make sure to always verify the response is correct by reviewing the references.
