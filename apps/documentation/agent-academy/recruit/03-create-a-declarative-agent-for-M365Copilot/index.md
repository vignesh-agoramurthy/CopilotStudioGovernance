## 🧪 Lab 03: Build a declarative agent in Microsoft Copilot Studio for Microsoft 365 Copilot {#lab-03-build-a-declarative-agent-in-microsoft-copilot-studio-for-microsoft-365-copilot}

We'll next learn how to build a declarative agent for a "Business-to-Employee" use case which will act as an **IT helpdesk agent**.

> [!NOTE]
> This lab will outline steps to add a Prompt as a tool. The following lessons will dive into adding knowledge sources and adding other tools available. 

### 👩🏻‍💼 Understanding Business-to-Employee (B2E) {#understanding-business-to-employee-b2e}

Business-to-Employee (B2E) refers to the interactions and services that a business provides directly to its employees. In the context of an agent, it means using the advanced capabilities of Copilot Studio to support and enhance the work experience of employees within the organization.

### ✨ Use case scenario {#use-case-scenario}

**As an** employee

**I want to** get quick and accurate help from the IT helpdesk agent for issues like device problems, network troubleshooting, printer setup

**So that I can** stay productive and resolve technical issues without delays

Let's begin!

1. Let's do a quick test of the agent we've created. Select one of the **Starter Prompts** in the test pane on the right hand side such as the `Explain IT Terms` prompt.

    Our agent will then respond. Notice how it adhered to the instructions by providing bullet points into digestible parts and also provided a summary.

    ![Response from the agent after selecting a suggested prompt](assets/3.1_11_TestResponse.png)

In a few minutes you've added a declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot in Copilot Studio 🙌🏻

Next we'll learn how to add a tool to our agent, we'll create a prompt.

### 3.2 Create and add a prompt for your declarative agent

1. Scroll down to the **Tools** section and select **+ Add tool**

    ![Add tool](assets/3.2_01_AddTool.png)

1. The Tools modal will appear and you can either create a new tool or select from the list of tools available. By default, a list of Power Platform connectors is displayed. Since we are going to add a Prompt, select **Prompt** under **Create new**.

    ![Select prompt](assets/3.2_02_SelectPrompt.png)

1. The Prompt modal appears, this is where we can define our prompt for our agent.

    Enter a name for the prompt. Let's name our prompt `IT Expert`.

    ![Enter name](assets/3.2_03_NamePrompt.png)

1. Select the **chevron icon** next to the **Model** to see the different [chat models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/prompt-model-settings) you can choose from. We'll stick with the selected default model.

    ![Change model](assets/3.2_04_ChangeModel.png)

1. Next, we'll provide our prompt with instructions. There's 3 methods that you can choose from

    - Use Copilot to generate instructions for you based on your description of what you want the prompt to do.
    - Use a preset template from the prompt library to create a prompt.
    - Manually enter your own instructions.

1. Let's first try using Copilot to generate instructions based on a description entered. Enter the following into the Copilot field and submit.

    ```text
    I need an IT expert that can help answer questions related to networking, computer systems, user devices and anything else IT related
    ```

    ![Get started with Copilot](assets/3.2_05_UseCopilot_EnterPrompt.png)

1. Copilot will then begin to generate a prompt for us.

    ![Copilot drafts prompts](assets/3.2_06_CopilotDraftingPrompt.png)

1. The Copilot generated draft instructions will then appear.

    ![Copilot generated draft instructions](assets/3.2_07_CopilotGeneratedInstructions.png)

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the instructions and you'll see the user input parameter already defined by Copilot. You then have the option to
    - Keep the draft instructions generated.
    - Refresh the draft instructions using Copilot.
    - Clear the draft instructions.

    Clear the draft instructions by selecting the **trash bin** icon and we'll next try the prompt library.

    ![Copilot generated prompt instructions and options available](assets/3.2_07_CopilotGeneratedInstructions.png)

1. Select the **prompt template** link.

    ![Select prompt template](assets/3.2_08_SelectPromptTemplate.png)

1. You'll see a list of prompt templates to choose from. These are from the [Power Platform Prompt library](https://aka.ms/power-prompts).

    ![Prompt library](assets/3.2_09_PromptLibrary.png)

1. Search for the `IT expert` prompt and select it.

    ![Select IT expert prompt](assets/3.2_10_SelectITExpertPrompt.png)

1. The prompt will then be added as the instructions with the input parameter as defined by the prompt template. Similar to the approach we took when providing instructions for our agent during the conversational creation experience with Copilot, this prompt template outlines
    - a task,
    - what type of inquiries it can handle,
    - and the format of its response and the goal of the prompt.

    ![Prompt instructions](assets/3.2_11_ITExpertPromptInstructions.png)

1. Clear the instructions and we'll next try manually entering the instructions. We'll use the [IT Expert prompt](https://adoption.microsoft.com/sample-solution-gallery/sample/pnp-powerplatform-prompts-it-expert/) from the [Power Platform Prompt library](https://aka.ms/power-prompts). Copy and paste the prompt.

    ```text
    I want you to act as an IT Expert. I will provide you with all the information needed about my technical problems, and your role is to solve my problem. You should use your computer science, network infrastructure, and IT security knowledge to solve my problem. Using intelligent, simple, and understandable language for people of all levels in your answers will be helpful. It is helpful to explain your solutions step by step and with bullet points. Try to avoid too many technical details, but use them when necessary. I want you to reply with the solution, not write any explanations. My problem is [Problem]
    ```

    ![Prompt instructions](assets/3.2_12_PromptInstructions.png)

1. Next, we can define the user input parameters of our prompt. These can be text and images, and sample data to test with. There's also the capability to ground the prompt with knowledge from Dataverse tables. For this exercise, we only have one user input to define which is the problem input. This is currently a placeholder in our prompt as `[Problem]`. We'll now configure this input either by entering the `/` character or selecting **+Add content** and then select **Text**.

    ![Text input](assets/3.2_13_AddContent.png)

1. We can now enter a name for our input parameter and sample data.

    Enter the following as the name

    ```text
    problem input
    ```

    Enter the following as the sample data

    ```text
    My laptop restarted unexpectedly. Any advice?
    ```

    Then select **Close**.

    ![Configure problem input](assets/3.2_14_NameSampleData.png)

1. The problem input parameter will now be added to the instructions with the configured sample data. We can now test our prompt!

    Select **Test** to the test the prompt.

    ![Test prompt instructions](assets/3.2_15_TestPrompt.png)

1. The model will be in-progress of generating a response.

    ![Model in-progress of generating its response](assets/3.2_16_ModelResponse.png)

1. The response will then display. Notice how the response provides headings with bullet points as per the instructions. Scroll down and review the remainder of the model response.

    ![Model response](assets/3.2_17_ModelResponse.png)

1. Before we save our prompt, let's learn about the settings that can be configured for this prompt. Select the **ellipsis (...) icon**.

    ![Prompt settings](assets/3.2_18_PromptSettings.png)

1. Here we'll see several settings that can be configured.

    - **Temperature**: Lower temperatures lead to predictable results, while higher temperatures allow more diverse or creative responses.
    - **Record retrieval**: Specify the number of records retrieved for your knowledge sources.
    - **Include links in the response**: When selected, the response includes link citations for the retrieved records.
    - **Enable code interpreter**: When this option is turned on, the code interpreter feature becomes active, allowing the agent to generate and run code.
    - **Content moderation level**: Lower content‑moderation levels allow more answers but increase the risk of harmful content. Higher moderation levels apply stricter filtering, reducing harmful content but also producing fewer answers.

    Select the **X** icon to exit from Settings.

    ![Configure settings](assets/3.2_19_ConfigurePromptSettings.png)

1. Select **Save** to save the prompt.

    ![Save prompt](assets/3.2_20_SavePrompt.png)

1. Next, select **Add and configure** to add the prompt to our declarative agent.

    ![Select add and configure](assets/3.2_21_AddAndConfigure.png)

1. The prompt will now appear under Tools 🙌🏻

    ![Prompt added](assets/3.2_22_PromptAddedAsTool.png)

We'll next update our instructions to invoke the prompt and test our declarative agent.

### 3.3 Update instructions and test your declarative agent

1. Scroll up to the **Details** section and select **Edit**. This will enable the fields to be editable.

    ![Select Edit](assets/3.3_01_EditInstructions.png)

1. We can now update our instructions to invoke our prompt by referencing the name of the prompt. Clear the instructions, then copy and paste the following.

    ```text
    When a user asks IT related questions such as questions on their device, run the "IT Expert- prompt". Use their question as the problem input of the "IT Expert- prompt".
    ```

    Notice how the final sentence is instructing the agent to use the question asked by the user as the value for the problem input parameter. The agent will use the question as the problem input for the prompt. Next, select **Save**.

    ![Update instructions to invoke prompt](assets/3.3_02_UpdateInstructionsWithPrompt.png)

1. We're now ready to test our updated instructions of our declarative agent. Select the **refresh icon** in the test pane.

    ![Select refresh icon](assets/3.3_03_RefreshTestPane.png)

1. Next, enter the following prompt below and submit.

    ```text
    My laptop restarted unexpectedly. Any advice?
    ```

    ![Perform test](assets/3.3_04_PerformTest.png)

1. The agent invokes the prompt and responds.

    ![Model response](assets/3.3_05_ModelResponse.png)

    ![Model response](assets/3.3_06_ModelResponse.png)

> [!NOTE] Model responses may differ across sessions
>
> AI-generated responses are non‑deterministic, so the same prompt may produce slightly different results each time.

Let's now publish our declarative agent.

### 3.4 Publish your declarative agent to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams

1. Select **Publish**.

    ![Publish agent](assets/3.4_01_PublishAgent.png)

1. A modal will appear which displays the Channels and publishing details that can be updated.

   - Channels: The agent will be published to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams.
   - Agent app information: This is what will be displayed when the user adds the agent to Microsoft 365 Copilot or in Microsoft Teams. These are fields that can be updated as needed.

    ![Agent app details](assets/3.4_02_ConfigurePublishingAgentDetails.png)

1. For example, you can update the **Short description**, **Long description**, **Developer name** with your name.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you don't see all the fields displayed on your browser, try zooming out e.g. 75%

    Select **Publish**. Copilot Studio will then begin publishing the agent.

      ![Publishing agent](assets/3.4_03_UpdatePublishingAgentDetails.png)


1. Select **Copy** for the Share link and in a new browser tab, paste the link.

    ![Copy link](assets/3.4_06_CopyLink.png)

1. Microsoft 365 Copilot will load and a modal will appear with the agent app details.
   Notice how the developer name, the short description and long description is displayed. These are from the publishing details updated in an earlier step.

    Select **Add**.

    ![Availability options](assets/3.4_07_AgentAppDetails.png)

1. Our declarative agent will load next. We can see the suggested prompts to select from which quickly enables users to seek immediate help.

    Select one of the suggested prompts which will automatically prepopulate the message Copilot field. Submit the question to Copilot.

    ![Select one of suggested prompts](assets/3.4_08_SelectStarterPrompt.png)

1. Select **Allow** to give your declarative agent permission to invoke the IT Expert prompt.

    ![Select always allow](assets/3.4_09_AlwaysAllow.png)

1. The agent will then invoke our **IT Expert** prompt and we'll see the model response returned as a message in our declarative agent.

    ![Response](assets/3.4_10_01_Response.png)

    Scroll down to see the full details of the response.

    ![Response](assets/3.4_10_02_Response.png)

1. But _how do we know_ the declarative agent invoked the prompt? 👀 Well, here's a tip!

    > [!TIP]
    > You can test and debug agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot by enabling [developer mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/debugging-copilot-agent#use-developer-mode-in-copilot-chat/?WT.mc_id=power-172614-ebenitez).

    Enter the following in the message Copilot field and submit.

    -developer on
    ```

    A confirmation message will appear to let you know developer mode is now enabled.

    ![Developer mode enabled](assets/3.4_11_DeveloperModeEnabled.png)

1. Submit the following question to invoke the prompt.

    ```text
    My laptop restarted unexpectedly. Any advice?
    ```

    ![Enter question](assets/3.4_12_EnterQuestion.png)

1. We'll see a model response from our **IT Expert** prompt again returned as a message. Scroll down to the bottom of the message and a card with debug information is displayed.

    Expand **Agent Debug Info** by selecting it.

    ![Agent debug info](assets/3.4_13_AgentDebuggingInfo.png)

1. Here you'll find information on the agent metadata that occurred at runtime.

    In our use case, we'll be focusing on the _Actions_ section:

    - **Matched actions** highlight the current status of functions found during the app's search.
    - **Selected actions** highlight the current status of functions chosen to run based on the app's decision-making process.

    So here we can see the agent orchestrator chose to invoke the IT Expert prompt as per the instructions of our declarative agent.

    ![Agent debug info expanded](assets/3.4_14_01_ReviewAgentDebugInfo.png)

    This is further outlined in the _Executed Actions_ section which also tells us that it successfully invoked the prompt and used our question as the value for our `problem input` parameter.

    ![Agent debug info expanded](assets/3.4_14_02_ReviewAgentDebugInfo.png)

    ![Review agent debug info](assets/3.4_14_03_ReviewAgentDebugInfo.png)

1. To turn off developer mode, enter the following in the message Copilot field and submit.

    ```text
    -developer off
    ```

    A confirmation message will appear to let you know developer mode is disabled. Cool, now you know how to verify whether your declarative agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot invoked your prompt 🌞
